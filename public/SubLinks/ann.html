<p>The Annapurna base camp trek is one of the most popular treks in the world. It literally brings you face to face with an eight thousander – for a moderate-difficult trek, this is incredible! The fascinating Annapurna massif includes the world’s tenth highest peak. Annapurna I (8,091 m) holds an almost fatal attraction for mountaineers. It has the highest fatality ratio among the eight thousanders. This formidable aura apart, the ABC trek holds several treasures for the mountain lover.</p>
<p>The Annapurna range whets your appetite for mountain views right from Pokhara. This is even before you start the trek. At Ghandruk, you get distinct views of Machapuchare, Annapurna South and Hiunchuli. Views of different peaks of the Annapurna massif and Machapuchare stay with you all the way till Sinuwa. The tip of Machapuchare teases you at Dovan. As you burst out of the forest past Himalaya and Deurali, Machapuchare appears before you in its full glory.</p>
<p>Machapuchare, the ‘fish tailed mountain’, is revered by the Nepalese for its exquisite beauty. It is believed to be one of the homes of Lord Shiva. It has never been officially summitted! At the Machapuchare base camp, in addition to Machapuchare, you will see Annapurna I, Annapurna South, Gangapurna and Hiunchuli up close.
The Annapurna Base Camp is a small cluster of lodges opposite the Annapurna glacier. As you look up from the edge of the glacier, you come face to face with the Annapurna massif. Annapurna I, III and South, Gangapurna, Gandharvachuli and Machapuchare are all there to meet your gaze when your eyes rest upon them.</p>
